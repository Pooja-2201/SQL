Amazon has partnered with multiple airlines to enhance their in-flight entertainment systems. As part of this initiative, you are tasked with developing a feature that suggests movies from Amazon's content database.
For flight 101, suggest movies with runtimes less than or equal to the flight's duration.
entertainment_catalog table:
Column Name	    Description
movie_id	    Identifier of movie

flight_schedule table:
Column Name        	Description
flight_id	        Identifier of flight
flight_duration	    Flight duration
